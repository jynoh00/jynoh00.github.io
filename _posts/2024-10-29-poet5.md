#### <center>Invictus - William Ernest Henley</center>
<br>
<center>
Out of the night that covers me,<br>
Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
I thank whatever gods may be<br>
For my unconquerable soul.<br>
<br>
In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>
<br>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>
<br>
It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
I am the master of my fate,<br>
I am the captain of my soul.
